**NOTE: This is a toy package created for expository purposes, for the second edition of [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org). It is not meant to actually be useful. If you want a package for factor handling, please see [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org).**

Factors are a very useful type of variable in R, but they can also be very aggravating. This package provides some helper functions for the care and feeding of factors.


## Installation

You can install the released version of foofactors from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("foofactors")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vgharris3/foofactors_vgh3")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

Binding two factors via `fbind()`:

```{r example}
library(foofactors)
## basic example code
a <- factor(c("character", "hits", "your", "eyeballs"))
b <- factor(c("but", "integer", "where it", "counts"))
```

Simply catenating two factors leads to a result that most don't expect.



```{r}
c(a, b)
```

The `fbind()` function glues two factors together and returns factor.

```{r}
fbind(a, b)
```

Often we want a table of frequencies for the levels of a factor. The base `table()` function returns an object of class `table`, which can be inconvenient for downstream work.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
x <- factor(sample(letters[1:5], size = 100, replace = TRUE))
table(x)
```

The `fcount()` function returns a frequency table as a tibble with a column of factor levels and another of frequencies:

```{r}
fcount(x)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
